# Statistical-Analysis-by-Excel-2016_Fall

This is class 101 of the program of BA. The formal name of this class is "Quantitative Analysis of Uncertainty and Risk for Business", but 
actually it is data analysis with Excel. We learned Normal, Z, T, F, Chisq, Poisson, Binomial, Hypothesis testing, Confidence interval, 
Linear Regression, ANOVA, Residuals, Percentile, Histogram, Pivot table, Boxplot,...etc by Add-In and Data Analysis of Excel. 

This class has no assignment nor project but on-line tests, what I can upload here is some worksheet.
